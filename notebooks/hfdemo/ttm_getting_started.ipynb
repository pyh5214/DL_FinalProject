        "\n",
        "This notebooke demonstrates the usage of a pre-trained `TinyTimeMixer` model for several multivariate time series forecasting tasks. For details related to model architecture, refer to the [TTM paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03955.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we will use a pre-trained TTM-512-96 model. That means the TTM model can take an input of 512 time points (`context_length`), and can forecast upto 96 time points (`forecast_length`) in the future. We will use the pre-trained TTM in two settings:\n",
        "1. **Zero-shot**: The pre-trained TTM will be directly used to evaluate on the `test` split of the target data. Note that the TTM was NOT pre-trained on the target data.\n",
        "2. **Few-shot**: The pre-trained TTM will be quickly fine-tuned on only 5% of the `train` split of the target data, and subsequently, evaluated on the `test` part of the target data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: Alternatively, this notebook can be modified to try any other TTM model from a suite of TTM models. For details, visit the [Hugging Face TTM Model Repository](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r2).\n",
        "\n",
        "1. IBM Granite TTM-R1 pre-trained models can be found here: [Granite-TTM-R1 Model Card](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r1)\n",

        "TTM Model card offers a suite of models with varying `context_length` and `prediction_length` combinations.\n",
        "In this notebook, we will utilize the TSFM `get_model()` utility that automatically selects the right model based on the given input `context_length` and `prediction_length` (and some other optional arguments) abstracting away the internal complexity. See the usage examples below in the `zeroshot_eval()` and `fewshot_finetune_eval()` functions. For more details see the [docstring](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-tsfm/blob/main/tsfm_public/toolkit/get_model.py) of the function definition."

We have to make sure that the required context and prediction lengths are passed to the `TimeSeriesPreprocessor()` so that the data batches are generated correctly. In this notebook, this is handled in the `zeroshot_eval()` and `fewshot_finetune_eval()` functions."
